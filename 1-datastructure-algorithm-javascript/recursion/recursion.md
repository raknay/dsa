### Recursion

* In recursion a function calls itself with smaller inputs until it hits the base case. The smaller input is required else we will be stuck in an infinite loop of function calls.
* While writing recursive code, we have to understand how call stack works in a programing language. If we make a lot of recursive calls then we might run out of memory.
