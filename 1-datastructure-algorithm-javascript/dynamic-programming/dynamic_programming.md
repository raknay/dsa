### Dynamic Programming
There are few aspects of dynamic programming
* We can choose between given options.
* We will be asked to find optimal solutions (max, min, longest, shortest, etc)
* We use recursion with storage(memoization) to solve dynamic programming.
* Recursive function should call itself with smaller inputs.
* We can also omit recursive and memoization with top-down approach.
