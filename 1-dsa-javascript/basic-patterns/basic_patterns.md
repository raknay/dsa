### Basic Patterns

* Counting From Array or Strings:  
While counting form arrays or strings try not to use nested loops, which would increase the time complexity to O(n^2).
* Looping by using multiple variables:  
Sometimes it's beneficial to use multiple variables while loping to avoid nested loops(e.g one points to the starting element of iterable and another one points to the last element)
* Sliding Window:  
Sometimes we have to consider a sub-array or a sub-string in order to perform some logical operations. In such cases sliding window method is applicable.
